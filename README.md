  This repo is a collection of my posts that I believe will be helpful to others pursuing knowledge in the areas of `Javascript`, `HTML`, `CSS` or whatever subject sounds interesting. I'm by no means an expert in these areas, but in order to help myself retain the knowledge I've decided to write it down here. If it ends up helping others in the process then that's awesome and I'd love to hear any feedback you may have.

  Please let me know if you have any questions, want to contribute or simply have a suggestion on what to write about. I'd be happy to include any posts from contributors that have something they'd like to write about, but are unsure what to do with it. If you find something incorrect, don't hesitate to make changes and submit them back to me or just let me know and I'll gladly make the change.
